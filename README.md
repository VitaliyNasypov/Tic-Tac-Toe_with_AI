<b><h2>Project JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org): Tic-Tac-Toe with AI</h2></b><br>

<b>About</b><br>
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!<br>
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and methods, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.<br><br>

<b>Stage 1: Initial setup</b><br>
Learn how to work with the field and the coordinates.<br><br>

<b>Stage 2: Easy does it</b><br>
Make an easy difficulty level where the computer just makes random moves: simple to make and not too challenging to beat.<br><br>

<b>Stage 3: Watch 'em fight</b><br>
Whether you want to play with a friend or take a break and watch computers battle it out, you can do both!<br><br>

<b>Stage 4: Signs of intelligence</b><br>
Let’s create a medium difficulty level. This AI should be a lot harder to beat! Are you up to the challenge?<br><br>

<b>Stage 5: An undefeated champion</b><br>
Oh no, what have we created here? An unbeatable AI monster! Indeed, this complex algorithm Minimax guarantees a win or a draw.<br><br>
